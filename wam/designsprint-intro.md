## Reducing time to market for competitive Customer Experience
Design Sprints, or Innovation Sprints as they sometimes are also called, are a leading methodology in reducing time to market for new Customer Experience and product development. They are also a key tool in increasing the level of innovation in an organisation, as well as speeding up the pace of innovation.    
Getting rid of UX and CX bottlenecks

For organisations that have yet to fill the need of UX and CX resources, Design Sprints are an excellent way of reducing such bottlenecks that affect the velocity of cross-functional teams negatively. As well as lowering the amount of ‘design ahead’ and unvalidated investments in design that often becomes a habit when CX isn’t developed in an agile way. 

## Excellent format for continuous exploration
Design and Innovation Sprints are also an excellent format for ART teams in which to conduct their continuous exploration. Especially since the method is based upon and thrives in a multi-role setting. And since you handle stakeholder issues within the format.   

## Get a validated prototype in one sprint!
The magic of the Design Sprint is that you go from defining what the actual problem to solve actually is, to testing a prototype that validates your hypothesis in one week or one sprint. And the methodology has a very succinct way of framing what the prototype should entail in order to bring maximum value to the team. 

## Reality learning, not rigid theory 
Emanuel Felix Tunbjer and Magnus Westerberg both share extensive experience from leading agile digital product development and Customer Experience ditto. They will teach you how to use Design Sprints to the max from the trenches, not from a book. 

- What are the crucial steps in a Design Sprint and how to maximize them?
- How to fit a Design Sprint to an available time slot?
- How to implement Design Sprints as a recurring innovation and exploration phase, instead of one off events?
