# Cover with pen loop

## Why are so many notebooks missing a pen loop?
It's a bit strange to see how many notebooks that come without a pen loop. Even the market share giant Moleskine are missing out on this feature on all standard models. And tries instead to solve it with cumbersome pen caps and accessory ribbons across the whole notebook. 

Just the fact that these 'solutions' exist should be evidence enough that it's a very natural component of a well-functioning notebook.
